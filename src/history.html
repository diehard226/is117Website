<img src= "img/timeline.png "style="width:906px;">
<br>
<h2> 1950-1959</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1957 USSR launches Sputnik into space and, with it, global communications.</li>
  
  <li> 1958 Bell Labs researchers invent the modem (modulator - demodulator), which converts digital signals to electrical (analog) signals and back, enabling communication between computers.</li>
  
  <li>1958 The United States government creates the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in response to Sputnik launch.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2> 1960-1969</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1961 Leonard Kleinrock Pioneers Packet-Switching </li>
  
  <li>1962 J.C.R. Licklider writes memos about his Intergalactic Network concept of networked computers and becomes the first head of the computer research   program at ARPA. </li>
  
  <li>1963 The first universal standard for computers, ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Exchange) is developed by a joint industry-government committee. ASCII permits machines from different manufacturers to exchange data. </li>
  
  <li>1964-1967 The Rand Corporation's Paul Baran develops message blocks in the U.S., while Donald Watts Davies, at the National Physical Laboratory in Britain, simultaneously creates a similar technology called packet-switching. The technology revolutionizes data communications. </li>
  
  <li>1965 ARPA sponsors study on cooperative network of time-sharing computers. </li>
  
  <li>1965 Lawrence Roberts (MIT) and Thomas Marill get an ARPA contract to create the first wide-area network (WAN) connection via long distant dial-up between a TX-2 computer in Massachusetts and a Q-32 computer in California. The system confirms that packet switching offers the most promising model for communication between computers.</li>
  
  <li>1966 Building on the 1965 Cooperative Network of Time-sharing Computers study, MIT's Lawrence Roberts comes to ARPA to conduct the networking experiment and develop the first ARPAnet plan ("Towards a Cooperative Network of Time-Shared Computers"). </li>
  
  <li>1966 Directing ARPA's computer research program, Robert Taylor initiates the ARPAnet project, the foundation for today's Internet. </li>
  
  <li>1966 As ARPA director, Charles Herzfeld approves funding to develop a networking experiment that would tie together multiple universities funded by the agency. The result would be the ARPAnet, the first packet network and a predecessor to today's Internet. </li>
  
  <li>1967 Danny Cohen develops the first real-time visual flight simulator on a general purpose computer and the first real-time radar simulator. His flight simulator work leads to the development of the Cohen-Sutherland computer graphics line clipping algorithms, created with Ivan Sutherland. </li>
  
  <li>1967 Lawrence Roberts leads ARPAnet design discussions and publishes first ARPAnet design paper: "Multiple Computer Networks and Intercomputer Communication."  Wesley Clark suggests the network is managed by interconnected 'Interface Message Processors' in front of the major computers. Called IMPs, they evolve into today's routers. </li>
  
  <li>1967 Donald Watts Davies of the National Physical Laboratory in England publishes his paper on packet-switching, the term he coins. </li>
  
  <li>1968 US Senator Edward Kennedy sends BBN a congratulatory telegram on winning the ARPA contract to build the "Interfaith" Message Processors. </li>
  
  <li>1968 Steve Crocker heads UCLA Network Working Group under Professor Leonard Kleinrock to develop host level protocols for ARPAnet communication in preparation for becoming the first node.  The group, which includes Vint Cerf and Jon Postel, lays the foundation for protocols of the modern Internet. </li>
  
  <li>1968 Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) is awarded the ARPA contract to build the Interface Message Processors.  </li>
  
  <li>1969 The first data packets are sent between networked computers on October 29th by Charley Kline at UCLA, under supervision of Professor Leonard Kleinrock. The first attempt resulted in the system crashing as the letter G of "Login" was entered.  The second attempt was successful. </li>
  
  <li>1969 Dr. Howard Frank co-writes the proposal that wins the contract to design the network structure for the ARPAnet. </li>
  
  <li>1969 The physical Interface Message Processor (IMP) network is constructed, linking four nodes: University of California at Los Angeles, SRI (in Stanford), University of California at Santa Barbara, and University of Utah.</li>
</ul>

  <li>1972 Robert Kahn demonstrates the ARPAnet to the public for the first time by connecting 20 different computers at the International Computer Communication Conference, and in doing so, imparts the importance of packet-switching technology. </li>
  
  <li>1972 While at the Information Science Institute, Jon Postel helps create the first Internet address registry, which later becomes Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This administers IP addresses and other critical Internet functions.  </li>
  
  <li>1972 Louis Pouzin leads the French effort to build CYCLADES, France's version of the ARPAnet. </li>
  
  <li>1973 Danny Cohen was the first to implement "packet video" and "packet voice" (Network Voice Protocol) when he adapted the visual flight simulator to run over the ARPANET in 1973.  It was the first application of packet switching to real-time applications.  </li>
  
  <li>1973 The first international connection to the ARPAnet is made by University College of London (England) via NORSAR (Norway). </li>
  
  <li>1973 Development begins on what will eventually be called TCP/IP protocol by a group headed by Vint Cerf (Stanford) and Robert Kahn (DARPA). The new protocol will allow diverse computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other. </li>
  
  <li>1974 Lawrence Roberts helps Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) found Telenet, the first public packet data service, a commercial version of ARPAnet. </li>
  
  <li>1974 Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler begins to help lead SRI International's Network Information Center (NIC), where her group eventually develops the first Internet "yellow-" and "white-page" servers, the first query-based network host name and address (WHOIS) server, and the Host Naming Registry for the Internet. As a part of this effort she and her group develop the top-level domain naming schemes of .com, .edu, .gov, .mil, .org, and .net. </li>
  
  <li>1974 Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn publish "A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection" which specifies in detail the design of a Transmission Control Program (TCP) and coins the term "Internet" for the first time. </li>
